# 🐦✈️ Bird Strike Data Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

This project visualizes and analyzes bird strike incidents between 2000–2011 using aviation safety data. Power BI was used to uncover patterns, identify high-risk airlines and airports, and assess the financial impact of wildlife collisions on the aviation industry.

## 📊 Project Overview

- 📁 **Tool Used:** Microsoft Power BI
- 📄 **Dataset Size:** 25,559 rows × 26 columns
- 🔍 **Scope:** Wildlife collisions with aircraft, reported by multiple airlines and airports over 11 years

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Visualize bird strike data across airlines, airports, and time periods
2. Compare **actual bird strike counts** with **reported counts**
3. Identify **airlines and airports** with the highest number of incidents and costs
4. Examine trends based on flight phases and altitudes
5. Highlight months and years with peak wildlife strikes

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Removed rows with missing critical values (e.g., altitude, airport name)
- Changed data types (e.g., converted flight date from datetime to date only)
- Final dataset: clean, structured, ready for Power BI visuals
